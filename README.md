# AGS Script Tree Sitter Parser

This is an experimental project. The general idea is to reuse the AGS Script Tree
Sitter parser generated by Edmundito, add C# bindings using SWIG and build it
for multiplatform (Windows/MacOS/Linux) using CMake.

This project is largely inspired by the [python java tree sitter parser here](https://github.com/ericoporto/python-tree-sitter). The cmake parts are made with code from the [tree-sitter-cmake project here](https://github.com/Symbitic/tree-sitter-cmake), but code has been heavily updated to work with latest tree-sitter.
